# Secure Notes

Written in the [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) framework.

## About
This app aims to be a very simple alternative to the existing notes applications that aren't as secure or privacy-focused. 

## Why this secure notes app?
* State of the art [encryption](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_string_encryption) (AES/CBC/PKCS5/Random IVs/HMAC-SHA256 Integrity Check)
* Open source
* Cross-platform (available both on Android and iOS)

## Status
So far you can only save notes to shared preferences, no encryption yet.
